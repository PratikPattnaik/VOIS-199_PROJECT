Spam Mail Detection was a project in which I collaborated with my friend Yogesh
This project focuses on developing a system to detect and prevent spam emails and messages.
The system utilizes a variety of machine learning techniques to accurately identify and filter out malicious emails.
Various features such as email content analysis, sender reputation, content filtering, and recipient filtering are employed to ensure maximum effectiveness.
The system was tested with a large dataset and we achieved an accuracy of 99%.
